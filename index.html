                <p>I am a hard working individual who has a passion for creating responsive web applications. I have recently completed a 3 month intensive full stack coding bootcamp course with Codenation, where I learnt HTML5, CSS, JavaScript including React.js and Node.js.

                    <p>After looking for a career change, in April 2022 I took the brave decision of leaving my job and enrolling in a 3 month full stack web development bootcamp with Codenation.</p>
                    <p>During my time with Codenation, I learned HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I also learned quite a few JavaScript frameworks such as React.js and Node.js</p>
                    <p>I learned lots of skills, both coding related and interpersonal skills such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Working on my own and also within a team</li>
                        <li>Contributing ideas and participating in daily stand up meetings</li>
                        <li>Server-side programming using Node.js and NPM</li>
                        <li>DOM manipulation using JavaScript</li>
                        <li>CRUD operations and working with databases using MySQL and MongoDB</li>
                        <li>Creating web servers using Express.js</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The bootcamp was 12 weeks long, and it was split so that we spent the first 6 weeks learning front end and the last six weeks learning back end web development</p>
                    <p>During the bootcamp I learned skills such as pair programming, object orientated programming and CI/CD principles</p>
                    <p>I created and participated in numerous personal & team projects, all of which are available to view on my <a href="https://github.com/moh-qureshi">Github.</a></p>

                        <p>I created a snake game where the user moves around the snake using the arrow keys collecting food.</p>
                        <p>As the snake eats each food, the snake gets bigger and faster, gradually making the game more difficult.</p>
                        <p>The game ends if the snake's head touches any part of its body, or if the snake hits the end of the game screen.</p>

                        <p>The snake game comes complete with a full levelling and scoring system, where the game gets more difficult as the levels progress.</p>
                        <p>The UI also grants several options to the user for how they would like to play the game, such as turning the music or sound off, and whether they would like to play the game in light mode or dark mode.</p>
                        <p>With the sound setting on, the game features nice background music along with audio cues when the user reaches a new level or every time the snake eats the food.</p>
                        <p>There is also a pause game function if the user decides to take a break and also a new game function if the user wants to restart.</p>
                        <p>Once the game is over, the game displays the final score to the user, and allow the user to start a new game.</p>

                        <h1>Design</h1>
                        <p>The snake game features various shades of green which are consistent through each menu, and the colour changes to a darker shade if the user selects dark mode.</p>
                        <p>The game screen is placed at the center of the screen, and makes up nearly all of the webpage. The game screen is differentiated from the background with a darker shade, keeping consistent with the design colours.</p>
                        <p>The navbar is situated at the top of the webpage to allow the user to see all of the various information and settings easily on the screen whilst playing the game.</p>

                        <p>I created a weather app which allows the user to input an address by searching either a city/town name or postcode.</p>
                        <p>After searching the inputted location, the app then displays the current weather along with some other various useful information such as the current time, the day of the week and the temperature.</p>
                        <p>Once a location is entered, a navigation bar appears at the top of the screen along with some information and another search bar, where the user is also able to search a different location.</p>

                        <p>The UI also automatically changes to light mode or dark mode depending on the time of the inputted location.</p>
                        <p>The icons used to display the weather allow the user to quickly and easily see what the weather is like in the inputted location.</p>

                        <p>The landing page of the weather app is simplistic and the user is greeted with a search bar which alerts the user to enter a location.</p>
                        <p>The app gets the data from a weather API I used, and displays the information in a clean, readable format to the user.</p>
                        <p>The location information is displayed on the navbar at the top of the screen and the main weather information is displayed in the center. Other useful/advanced weather information is displayed in a marquee under the navigation bar.</p>
